Welcome to my dotfiles repo! In this repo you will find my public configurations including an install script.

Feel free to use any of this for inspiration, but note that I do not plan on ensuring compatibility. (_These are my personal dotfiles and I may change them on a whim._)

> **General mindset**

> Minimize config by embracing defaults

If you have tips/tricks/etc, I'd love to hear them! Cheers

## TL;DR

- 📜️Single install script
- 📦Brew for package manager
- 🐟fish shell
- 🔌 vim-plug (and neovim)

## Install

1. Clone this repo into your `$HOME` directory (the script expects `$HOME/dotfiles` to be this repo)
2. Run the install script: `./install.sh`
3. Restart to see all changes

## Things to do

- [X] Single install script
- [ ] Document (educational, for memory)
- [ ] App settings (e.g. VS Code extensions)
- [X] Source "local" file (allow private config) → `~/local.fish`
