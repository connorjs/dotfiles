Welcome to my dotfiles repo! In this repo you will find my public configurations
including an install script.

If you have tips/tricks/etc, I‚Äôd love to hear them! Cheers

## TL;DR

- üìú Single install script
- üì¶ [Homebrew] for package manager
- üêü [fish shell][fish]
- üîå vim-plug (and [neovim])

## Install

1. Clone this repo into `$HOME/w/connorjs` (_see next section for why_)
2. Run the install script: `./install.sh`
3. Edit `.gitconfig` (or use `git config --global`)
4. Restart to see all changes

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/w/connorjs && \
cd $HOME/w/connorjs && \
git clone https://github.com/connorjs/dotfiles.git && \
cd dotfiles && \
./install.sh && \
cd $HOME && \
vim .gitconfig
```

## File system

### XDG config

`$HOME/.config`: I prefer to use the XDG config pattern where possible.

The install script uses `stow` to link this repositories packages. For example,
`.vimrc` ends up in `$HOME` and the `init.vim` script ends up in
`$HOME/.config/nvim` as expected. Also see [‚ÄúUsing GNU Stow to manage your
dotfiles‚Äù][stow-blog-post].

_The package names in this repository exist as preferred logical naming. Only
this install script uses them; they do not appear in the target file system._

### Workspaces

`$HOME/w`: Workspaces for code repositories. I name it `w` for brevity. If
needed, create `w` on the appropriate drive and symlink to it from `$HOME`.

Namespacing: Regardless of tooling, I see namespacing for code repositories.
GitHub has the user or organization, AWS has the account, and Azure DevOps has
the project.

I match this namespacing with the first-level directory structure under `w`.
For example, this repository will exist at `$HOME/w/connorjs/dotfiles`.

_Note: I have considered having separate workspaces or another directory per
tool. For example, `~/gh` or `~/w/gh` for GitHub. However, I have yet to hit
conflicts that warrant this additional namespace scheme._
