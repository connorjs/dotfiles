# Connor's dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo! In this repo you will find my public configurations including an install script.

Feel free to use any of this for inspiration, but note that I do not plan on ensuring compatibility. (_These are my personal dotfiles and I may change them on a whim._)

> Minimize config by embracing defaults

If you have tips/tricks/etc, I'd love to hear them! Cheers

## TL;DR

- 📜️Single install script
- 📦Brew for package manager
- 🐟fish shell
- 🔌 vim-plug

## Install

1. Clone this repo into your `$HOME` directory (the script expects `$HOME/dotfiles` to be this repo)
2. Run the install script: `./install.sh`
3. Restart to see all changes

## Things to do

- [X] Single install script
- [ ] Document (educational, for memory)
- [ ] App settings (e.g. VS Code extensions)
- [X] Source "local" file (allow private config) → `~/local.fish`
