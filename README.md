Welcome to my dotfiles repo! In this repo you will find my public configurations including an install script.

Feel free to use any of this for inspiration, but note that I do not plan on ensuring compatibility. (_These are my personal dotfiles and I may change them on a whim._)

> **General mindset**

> Minimize config by embracing defaults

If you have tips/tricks/etc, I'd love to hear them! Cheers

## TL;DR

- üìúÔ∏èSingle install script
- üì¶Brew for package manager
- üêüfish shell
- üîå vim-plug (and neovim)

## Install

1. Clone this repo into your `$HOME` directory (the script expects `$HOME/dotfiles` to be this repo)
2. Run the install script: `./install.sh`
3. Restart to see all changes

## File system

- `$HOME/.config`: XDG config pattern. I prefer to use this where possible.

  The install script uses `stow` to link this repositories packages. For
  example, `.vimrc` ends up in `$HOME` and the `init.vim` script ends up in
  `$HOME/.config/nvim` as expected.

  _The package names in this repository exist as preferred logical naming. Only
  this install script uses them; they do not appear in the target file system._ 

- `$HOME/w`: Workspaces for code repositories. I name it `w` for brevity. If
  needed, create `w` on the appropriate drive and symlink to it from `$HOME`.

  Namespacing: Regardless of tooling, I see namespacing for code repositories.
  GitHub has the user or organization, AWS has the account, and Azure DevOps has
  the project.

  I match this namespacing with the first-level directory structure under `w`.
  For example, this repository will exist at `$HOME/w/connorjs/dotfiles`.

  _Note: I have considered having separate workspaces or another directory per
  tool. For example, `~/gh` or `~/w/gh` for GitHub. However, I have yet to hit
  conflicts that warrant this additional namespace scheme._   

## Things to do

- [X] Single install script
- [ ] Document (educational, for memory)
- [ ] App settings (e.g. VS Code extensions)
- [X] Source "local" file (allow private config) ‚Üí `~/local.fish`
