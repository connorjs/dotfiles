I have made the same three modifications to each emoji image.

1. Renamed the unicode-based filenames to their emoji name. For example,
   `1F41F.svg` becomes `fish.svg`.

2. Added `width=16` to force 16 px default rendering given the intended use as
   inline body text.

3. Modified the SVG `viewBox` from `"0 0 72 72"` to `"0 -8 72 72"` to
   improve vertical alignment with inline text.
